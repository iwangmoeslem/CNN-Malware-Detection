# Malware Detection Using CNN Deep Learning Method with Early Stopping

## Summary 
Detecting malware is a key step while enjoying IoT devices that's connected to the internet.
However, handling milions of traffic in a short amount of time requires diligent works.
This project nurtures the complexibility of deep learning method such as CNN to extract complex patterns of large dataset like
IoT traffics and predicts wether one traffic consists malware or not. This project uses preprocessed IoT dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/engraqeel/iot23preprocesseddata)

## Tools
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Tensorflow
- Matplotlib
- sklearn

## Language
- Python

## Classification Steps
- Import data
- Preprocessing (Dimension reduction, Zero-filling, One-Hot-Encoding, Label encoding, Normalization)
- Layering
- Data training
- Callbacks (Early stopping, Safe best result)
